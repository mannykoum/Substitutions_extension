# Substitutions_extension
A silly little Chrome extension for applying xkcd's substitutions with the press of a button. Did it and then realized that someone else has made one (which is a lot better I must say). Either way this was a learning experience to learn how to make Chrome extensions.

## TODO:
1. Fix RegEx's so that only actual words are replaced (to avoid the buttbuttinate error).
2. Fix word finding so it can find phrases (it kinda does - test for all cases).
3. Fix the scripting problems (run the extension on a google search page to see).
4. Apply some id to the replacements that would allow someone to switch back.
5. Have options to apply substitutions from other xkcd comics and others.
6. Maybe add the ability for a user to add their own substitutions.
